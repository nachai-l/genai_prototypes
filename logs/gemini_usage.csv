### JD Preferred Requirements [✓: Pass | ✗: Missing]
1.  Proficiency with any of the major Machine Learning and Computer Vision frameworks. — ✓

### Candidate Strengths (1–5 bullets)
1.  Strong academic background with a Master's in Data Analytics and a Bachelor's in Nanoengineering, both with First Class Honors.
2.  Proficiency in key data science tools and languages including Python (with ML libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), SQL, and Tableau.
3.  Demonstrated ability to lead cross-functional teams and manage projects/products, indicating strong collaboration and communication skills.
4.  Practical experience in developing and deploying classification models and performing in-depth data analysis during the Data Scientist role.
5.  Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, supported by academic background and practical experience.

### Candidate Weaknesses (1–5 bullets)
1.  Significantly lacks the mandatory 5+ years of hands-on data science experience, with only 4 months explicitly in a Data Scientist role.
2.  Limited explicit experience with distributed computing, data pipelining tools, and data health/monitoring frameworks, which are mandatory requirements.
3.  The majority of professional experience is in Product Owner roles, which, while valuable for collaboration, does not directly fulfill the hands-on technical requirements of a Senior Data Scientist.

### JD vs CV Matching Score
**Score:** 4.5 / 10.0

**Reasoning (3–5 bullets):**
1.  The candidate possesses a strong academic foundation and proficiency in core data science tools (Python, SQL, Tableau, ML frameworks) and analytical skills, meeting most technical skill requirements.
2.  However, the candidate critically lacks the mandatory 5+ years of hands-on experience in data mining, statistical analysis, distributed computing, data pipelining, and data health frameworks, with only 4 months in a direct Data Scientist role.
3.  While the candidate demonstrates strong collaboration and project management skills from Product Owner roles, these do not directly substitute for the hands-on technical experience required for a Senior Data Scientist.
4.  The significant gap in direct, senior-level data science experience makes the candidate a poor fit for a *Senior* Data Scientist position, despite strong foundational knowledge and potential.",STOP,,717,1510,1805,4032

### JD Preferred Requirements [✓: Pass | ✗: Missing]
1. Proficiency with any of the major machine learning and computer vision frameworks. — ✓

### Candidate Strengths (1–5 bullets)
1. Strong academic background with an ongoing Master's in Data Analytics and a Bachelor's in Engineering.
2. Proficient in core data science tools and techniques including Python, SQL, Tableau, statistical analysis, and various machine learning models.
3. Demonstrated ability to lead cross-functional teams and manage projects effectively from extensive Product Owner experience.
4. Practical experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and building/testing classification models.
5. Strong analytical, critical thinking, and communication skills.

### Candidate Weaknesses (1–5 bullets)
1. Significantly lacks the mandatory 5+ years of hands-on data science experience, with only 4 months directly in a Data Scientist role.
2. Limited explicit experience with distributed computing, data pipelining tools, and data health/monitoring frameworks.
3. The Master's degree is still in progress, which might be a consideration for a Senior role requiring immediate full qualification.
4. No specific mention or demonstration of computer vision expertise, only general ML techniques.

### JD vs CV Matching Score
**Score:** 4.5 / 10.0

**Reasoning (3–5 bullets):**
1. The candidate critically misses the mandatory requirement of 5+ years of hands-on data science experience, having only 4 months in a direct Data Scientist role. This is a major gap for a Senior position.
2. While possessing a strong educational foundation (Master's in Data Analytics) and proficiency in key tools (Python, SQL, Tableau) and ML techniques, this does not compensate for the significant experience deficit for a Senior role.
3. The candidate demonstrates valuable transferable skills from Product Owner roles, such as project management, cross-functional collaboration, and analytical thinking, but these are not direct hands-on data science experience.
4. There is limited explicit evidence of experience with distributed computing, data pipelining, and data health/monitoring frameworks, which are mandatory requirements.
5. The candidate meets most other mandatory and preferred technical and soft skill requirements, indicating potential for a more junior data science role.",STOP,,705,1374,3076,5155
